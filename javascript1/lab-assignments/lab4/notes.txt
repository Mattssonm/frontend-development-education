My Digital Library - Backlog

As a user I want to easily view, modify and remove current books in my library. 
  *Books should be placed in a table 
  *When i click a book I want to be a able to directly modify or remove books.

As a user I really would prefer to not have to click a button to call for a key, but I would like to see the key. 
  *Call for key onload, and show it in the top left or top right corner, prompt any errors doing this. 
  
As a user I want to see any errors that might occur using the unstable API. 
  *A popup which slides up from the bottom of the page.

As a user I want to download a list of books into the page.
  *Hey, you dont seem to have any books in your library, do you want to download a premade list of books or create your own? 

As a user I would like to be able to sort books in title and author. 

As a user i would like to be able to search for books
  
As a user I don't want to see all books directly
  *Use pagination and view only 10 books on each page.
